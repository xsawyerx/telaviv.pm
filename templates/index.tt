                            <h4>Issac Goldstand - Distributed Apps with Gearman</h4>

                            <p>Gearman is a framework for writing distributed applications across many
                                        nodes.  It allows you to do work in parallel, load balance processes and
                                        write applications across several programming languages.  In this
                                        presentation we'll learn how to get started writing Gearman-powered
                                        applications in Perl.</p>
