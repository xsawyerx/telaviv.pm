      %dd 
        %p  The new age is all about non-blocking asynchronous creative responsive deconstructive
            refactored decoupled conjectured applications. If you're not on the event loop wagon
            loop, you're missing out!

      %dd
        %p A library for composing async programs. Because writing async code is hard, but working with Perl lists is easy. Lets turn events into lists, and reap the benefits:
        %ul
        %li Elegant async programming without callback nesting, using operators we all know from working with Perl lists</li>
        %li Managing and coordinating events, e.g. start an HTTP request when timeout on key press if previous HTTP request was OK and arrived in the last 10 seconds</li>
        %li Programming with stream transformations, instead of objects and methods-say hello to beautiful functional designs with well defined state and side-effects. Replace boring UML diagrams with fun marble diagrams</li>
        %li Stop writing and rewriting retry, timeout, throttle, buffer, window, counters, caching, and aggregate functions for each project. Instead create your processes as observables, then enjoy a rich library of existing operators</li>

        %strong Real Time Web with Pocket::IO :: Ynon Perek
      %dd
        The Internet is changing direction. More and more web-sites want to notify their visitors in real
        time about changes that happen on the server (for instance, a different visitor uploaded a photo).
        A library called Socket IO unifies all the various ways to send messages from the server to the
        computers of the visitors and allows the programmer to write an Internet application that gets updated
        in real time. vti implemented the library in Perl as Pocket::IO.
        In this talk, I will present the ideas behind Real Time Web, including code excerpts in Perl which
        use the library in order to create interactive sites.

      We could work on contributing to projects, fixing or adding features to
      existing projects, starting new projects, trying out different stuff we
      haven't yet, and learn new stuff!

      Here are some ideas for what to do at the hackathon:
    %ul
      %li rewriting a CGI app in Dancer, or add features to an existing web app
      %li rewriting an application using Moose
      %li contributing to a CPAN module (bugs/features/documentation/tests)

        A source of great concern in the Perl users community is whether to use an
        up-to-date Perl and what version should be considered "too old". On one hand,
        we have the management that wants as little cost and changes as possible
        (sometimes along with systems administrators), and on the other hand, the
        developer who wants to use the latest technologies, and is often stuck on
        obsolete systems. In light of this serious consideration, we're going to
        take turns poking at each other with a stick, wearing funny hats, damning the
        unbelievers and heretics until they submit to one side: 5.6 or 5.14!
